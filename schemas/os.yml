        On Windows, this is the value of `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\CurrentBuild`
        registry key. Optionally, the update build revision (UBR) can be added to `CurrentBuild` and
        be separated by a period (`.`). Example: `17763.1817`

        For macOS, this is the value of returned by the `sw_vers -buildVersion` command.

        On some Linux systems, this may be the value of the `BUILD_ID` parameter specified
        in `/etc/os-release`.
